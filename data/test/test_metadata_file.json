All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 19:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 20:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26","authors_parsed":[["Bal\u00e1zs","C.",""],["Berger","E.

This would appear to require 15-fold symbolic integrations over a\ncomplicated convex body (defined by both separability and feasibility\nconstraints). The associated 15-dimensional integrands -- in terms of the\nTilma-Byrd-Sudarshan Euler-angle-based parameterization of the 4 x 4 density\nmatrices \\rho (math-ph/0202002) -- would be the products of 12-dimensional Haar\nmeasure \\mu_{Haar} (common to each metric) and 3-dimensional measures\n\\mu_{metric} (specific to each metric) over the 3d-simplex formed by the four\neigenvalues of \\rho. We attempt here to estimate/determine the 3-dimensional\nintegrands (the products of the various [known] \\mu_{metric}'s and an unknown\nsymmetric weighting function W) remaining after the (putative) 12-fold\nintegration of \\mu_{Haar} over the twelve Euler angles. We do this by fitting W\nso that the conjectured HS separable volumes and hyperareas (quant-ph/0410238;\ncf. quant-ph/0609006) are reproduced. We further evaluate a number of possible\nchoices of W by seeing how well they also yield the conjectured separable\nvolumes for the Bures, Kubo-Mori, Wigner-Yanase and (arithmetic) average\nmonotone metrics and the conjectured separable Bures hyperarea\n(quant-ph/0308037,Table VI). We, in fact, find two such exact (rather similar)\nchoices that give these five conjectured (non-HS) values all within 5%. In\naddition to the above-mentioned Euler angle parameterization of \\rho, we make\nextensive use of the Bloore parameterization (J. Phys.
